## Reflection
- I chose this project as there are no YouTube tutorials on how to build such a thing and it would be a great challenge that would test my problem solving skills
- Although seemingly complex, I did experience that it is definitely possible if working on features one by one and I am most excited about implementing Google's free Gemini AI API to mimic Canva's "Magic Write" features
